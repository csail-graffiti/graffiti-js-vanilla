<h1>
  Logging In
</h1>

  <p>
    Graffiti apps are read-only unless you log in.
    To log in or out of Graffiti from a Vue app all you need to do is call the global <code class="language-js">$graffitiToggleLogIn</code> function.
    You can log in from any domain.
  </p>

  <p>
    To check whether a user is logged in, you can use the <code class="language-js">$graffitiMyActor</code> variable.
    This variable is equal to a user's unique URI if they are logged in and <code class="language-js">null</code> otherwise.
    We will come back to this variable in both <RouterLink to="/context">Â§Context</RouterLink> and <RouterLink to="/privacy">RouterLink</RouterLink>, but to make a basic button to log or out, we can just treat the variable as a boolean.
    For example:

    <GraffitiPlayground path="log-in" />
  </p>
