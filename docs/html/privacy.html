<h1>
  Privacy
</h1>

<p>
  Objects in Graffiti can only be found if you look in the right context.
  This design can be interpretted as a form of 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity">security through obscurity</a>
  or as a read-only form of
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model">
    object capabilities
  </a>:
  "if someone give's me a reference to the object then I can read it."
</p>

<p>
  This makes context good at providing short-term privacy: if an object does not exist for very long, like a snap in Snapchat, it is unlikely for the reference to that object to travel outside it's intended audience.
  Context is also good at providing some amount of social privacy
  if you assume that other people are being polite and not going <em>out of their way</em> to find things they are not meant to see.
  However, for strict long-term privacy
  Graffiti also allows for a form of privacy akin to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access-control_list">access control lists</a>.

<p>
  As we've mentioned every user has a unique "actor" URI. We can access it through <code class="language-js">$graffitiMyActor</code> and all objects made by a person must be signed with an <code class="language-js">actor</code> property.
  To make private messages we can take advantage of the <code class="language-js">bto</code> and <code class="language-js">bcc</code> fields.
