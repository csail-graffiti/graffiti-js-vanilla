<h1>Context</h1>

<p>
  In real life, social events occur in a physical <em>place</em>:
  something can happen "at home", "at work", or "downtown".
  Online, social events occur in more abstract places that we call <em>contexts</em>.
  You can post something "to your profile", you can reply "in a thread", or you can ask a question "in a subreddit".
</p>

<p>
  In the current online ecosystem, applications themselves often define broad contexts. For example, you can create a channel "on Slack"
  or make a profile "on Tinder".
</p>

<p>
  Contextual boundaries are important for giving space to different social norms.
  For example, when you go to a karaoke bar that you know everyone else in that space has implicitly consented to listen to amateur singing.
  The norms are quite different in, say, a library.
</p>

<p>
  Online communication reduces the time it takes for information to travel from one place to another to practically zero, which makes it easy for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_collapse">contexts to collapse</a>.
  This can lead to misinterpretation, toxic conflict, and a "spiral of silence".
  Therefore, preserving contextual boundaries is a fundamental role of Graffiti.

<h2>
  Implementation
</h2>

<p>
Every Graffiti object that is produced must include a <code class="language-js">context</code> property, an array of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">URIs</a>.
Every consumer of Graffiti objects must
specify a similar <code class="language-js">context</code> array.
Any object with a <code class="language-js">context</code> array that <em>intersects</em> a consumer's <code class="language-js">context</code> array will be returned to that consumer.
</p>

<p>
  FIGURE
</p>

<p>
  If you do not specify a <code class="language-js">context</code> either when you call <code class="language-js">$graffitiUpdate</code> or when you use <code class="language-js">GraffitiObjects</code>, the client library automatically defaults to setting <code class="language-js">context=[$graffitiMyActor]</code>.
  You can think of this context as your "profile" or your "wall"; it is where stuff connected to "you" resides.
  Since it is default, we didn't need to specify <code class="language-js">context</code> in the <RouterLink to="/object-basics">last section</RouterLink>.
</p>

<p>
  Other contexts can be:
  - other objects
  - virtual places (like domains)
  - real places
  - 
</p>

<p>
  Suppose however that a person has a specific name in a certain callback.
  Let's look over both objects in the actor callback and local callback and prioritize ones in the local context.
</p>

<p>
  Another thing we can do is make objects relative to other objects. We can reply
  Build a comment thread
</p>

<p>
  As stated above we can combine contexts. Consider comment that you can include both with id and

  table
  parent.id, $graffitiActorURI | Twitter
  parent.id | Instagram: the comment can only be seen. 
  $graffitiActorURI | quote Tweet: the comment can only be seen:

</p>

<h2>
  Implicit Context: <code class="language-js">id</code>
</h2>

<p>
  Every object can <em>implicitly</em> be found in the context of it's own <code class="language-js">id</code>.
  This means that an object's ID can act as a direct "link" to an object, regardless of whether the person with that link knows about the other contexts the object is associated with.
  For brevity, we include the renderless component <code class="language-js">GraffitiObject</code> which is essentially shorthand for

  <GraffitiPlayground path="graffiti-object-shorthand" :render="false"/>
</p>

<p>
  Find an object ID by modifying the code in another demo, then paste that ID in the one below to see the linked object.

  <GraffitiPlayground path="graffiti-object" :data="{id: ''}"/>
