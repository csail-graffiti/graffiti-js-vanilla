<h1>Context</h1>

<p>
  In real life, social events occur in a physical <em>place</em>:
  something can happen "at home," "at work," or "downtown".
  Online, social events occur in more abstract places that we call <em>contexts</em>.
  You can post something "to your profile", you can reply "in a thread", or you can ask a question "in a subreddit".
</p>

<p>
  In the current online ecosystem, applications themselves often define broad contexts. For example, you can create a channel "on Slack"
  or make a profile "on Tinder".
</p>

<p>
  Contextual boundaries are important for giving space to different social norms.
  For example, when you go to a karaoke bar that you know everyone else in that space has implicitly consented to listen to amateur singing.
  The norms are quite different in, say, a library.
</p>

<p>
  Online communication reduces the time it takes for information to travel from one place to another to practically zero, which makes it easy for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_collapse">contexts to collapse</a>.
  This can lead to misinterpretation, toxic conflict, and a "spiral of silence".
  Therefore, preserving contextual boundaries is a fundamental role of Graffiti.
</p>

<p>
Every Graffiti object that is produced must include a <code class="language-js">context</code> property, an array of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">URIs</a>.
Every consumer of Graffiti objects must
specify a similar <code class="language-js">context</code> array.
Any object with a <code class="language-js">context</code> array that <em>intersects</em> a consumer's <code class="language-js">context</code> array will be returned to that consumer.

<h2>
  Default Context: <code class="language-js">actor</code>
</h2>

<p>
  If you do not specify a <code class="language-js">context</code> either when you call <code class="language-js">$graffitiUpdate</code> or when you use <code class="language-js">GraffitiObjects</code>, the client library automatically defaults to setting <code class="language-js">context=[$graffitiMyActor]</code>.
  You can think of this context as your "profile" or your "wall"; it is where stuff connected to "you" resides.
  When we didn't to specify a <code class="language-js">context</code> in <RouterLink to="/object-basics">§Object Basics</RouterLink>, all those Boops and Bops went into your personal context.
</p>

<p>
  Note that even though this is "your" context, <em>you do not own it</em>.
  You have exclusive control over your own objects (as we described in <RouterLink to="object-basics">§Object Basics</RouterLink>) but nobody can control what is or isn't allowed in any context.
  This is an essential design decision in Graffiti that makes it so that no one person or organization can control the <em>means of communication</em>, even if that entity holds a high degree of social capital.
</p>

<p>
  Someone might create an object in your personal context to send you a private message; your context is a place that other people expect you to look so it also functions as your "inbox".
  A public object in your personal context is also a way for others to reach out to people who tend to follow things associated with your profile, i.e. your "friends" or "followers".
  This is analogous to tagged posts on Instagram for example.
</p>

<p>
  This model has clear drawbacks that we discuss in <RouterLink to="/moderation">§Moderation</RouterLink>.
</p>

<h2>
  Implicit Context: <code class="language-js">id</code>
</h2>

<p>
  Every object can <em>implicitly</em> be found in the context of it's own <code class="language-js">id</code>.
  This means that an object's ID can act as a direct "link" to an object, regardless of whether the person with that link knows about the other contexts the object is associated with.
  For brevity, we include the component <code class="language-js">GraffitiObject</code> which is essentially shorthand for

  <GraffitiPlayground path="graffiti-object-shorthand" :render="false"/>
</p>

<p>
  You can try out the component below.
  Find an object ID (perhaps modify to the code in another demo to print one out), then paste that ID to see the linked object.

  <GraffitiPlayground path="graffiti-object" :data="{id: ''}"/>
</p>

<h2>
  Other Contexts
</h2>

<p>
  Any URI can be a context.
  You can use these to talk about other objects, virtual places (like websites), real places, pieces of media, etc.
