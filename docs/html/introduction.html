<h1>
  Building a Graffiti App
</h1>

<p>
  Graffiti is an architecture that makes it possible to build malleable and interoperable social applications using nothing but standard front-end web development tools.
  This guide explains how to build these web apps with the <a href="https://github.com/graffiti-garden/graffiti-js">Graffiti client Javascript library</a> and it's plugin for the <a href="https://vuejs.org">Vue.js web framework</a>.
</p>

<p>
  If you're not familiar with Vue, make sure to check out the <a href="https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html">Vue docs</a> before getting started with this guide.
  Note that there is nothing inherently tying Graffiti to Vue, it just happens to be the first framework we added support for.
  If you're interested in make a Graffiti plugin for a different web framework, please <a href="mailto:graffiti@mit.edu">contact us</a> or make a pull request.
</p>

<p>
  This guide includes a number of interactive demos, like the one below. The included source code can be modified and the demo will update dynamically.
  Truly malleable social media!

  <code class="language-markup">graffiti-x-vue</code> is a library that lets you add custom social components to any static website
  via an extension to the <a href="https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html">Vue.js 3</a> Javascript framework that interfaces with the
  <a href="https://github.com/graffiti-garden/graffiti-server">Graffiti server</a>.
</p>
<p>
  On a high level, Graffiti is kind of like a shared database.
  However, unlike a normal database it has some special properties that makes it possible for people with different <router-link to="/context">organization</router-link> and <router-link to="/moderation">moderation</router-link> preferences to use it at the same time.
</p>

<p>
  Practically, the library exposes three properties:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code class="language-js">toggleLogIn</code>:
      A function that let's you log in and out of the Graffiti server via email.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code class="language-js">myID</code>: 
      A unique string associated with your Graffiti account.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code class="language-js">useCollection</code>:
      A <a href="https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/composables.html">Vue Composable</a> that let's you retrieve and modify dynamic collections of social data from the Graffiti server â€” this is where the magic happens!
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  This guide assumes you are pretty familiar with
  <a href="https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html">Vue</a>,
  so we're going to dive straight into building social components.
  These components can be hooked into the library by including the following code at the end of an HTML document within 
  <code class="language-html">&lt;script type="module"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> tags:
