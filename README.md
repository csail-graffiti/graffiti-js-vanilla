# Graffiti Javascript Library

This is the base Javascript library that interfaces with the [Graffiti server](https://github.com/graffiti-garden/graffiti-server). It also includes a plugin that extends it to operate with the [Vue.js framework](https://vuejs.org/).

Check out the live [demo](https://graffiti.garden/graffiti-js/demo) of the library and plugin in action. The demo's source code is in the `/demo` folder.
